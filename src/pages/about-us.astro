        heart of Leyton, our café offers a unique brunch experience inspired by

      <h3 class="font-extralight h2 my-4">Our Story</h3>
      <p class="p">
        Founded by Jalila Elmastouki, <strong>branché</strong> is the realization
        of a lifelong passion for food and creating spaces where people feel truly
        at home. After spending over 10 years in the fashion industry, I decided
        to follow my heart and embark on a new journey—one centered around the simple
        pleasures of good food, great company, and a cozy, inviting atmosphere.
      </p>
      <p class="p">
        Though my career in fashion was fulfilling, I always found myself drawn
        to the world of food and the comfort of spaces that felt like an
        extension of home. Inspired by my love for the warm, relaxed ambiance of
        places I’ve visited around the world, I decided to create a café that
        embodies that same feeling of warmth and connection.
      </p>
      <p class="p">
        After the success of our first location, we’re excited to open a second
        branch and continue sharing this special experience with more people in
        our community. Whether you're here to enjoy our signature Croissant
        Avocado Benedict or simply unwind with a cup of coffee, we want every
        moment spent at <strong>branché</strong> to feel like an escape into a place
        where you truly belong.
      </p>

        We believe in taking a fresh, thoughtful approach to food, using only
        the best local ingredients. Our menu is crafted with care, prioritizing

        delicious. We cater to all tastes—whether you’re craving something
        savory, sweet, or refreshing, we have a dish that’s perfect for you.
      </p>
      <p class="p">
