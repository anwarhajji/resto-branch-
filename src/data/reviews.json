The Loaded Fries were also a hit, especially the Spicy version with harissa and crispy onions. And don’t even get me started on the desserts—the Cookie Dough Pistachio & Kunafa was heavenly. A must-try for anyone who loves bold flavors!."

The only downside was that the French Tacos felt a bit overpriced for the portion size. Still, overall, a great dining experience with something for everyone"

I ended the meal with the Le Croockie, which was pure indulgence. Highly recommend this place for anyone looking for creative and tasty dishes."

The Special Loaded Fries were also a highlight, with the Algerian sauce adding a unique twist. And the La Pistachio Cookie dessert? Divine. This menu is a winner in every category!"
